Emergency Support Services is a team of volunteers that work with emergency services agencies to provide a variety of assets to aid in their work.

Our team is a community response organization based out of the Greater Cincinnati Area of Ohio. Those on our team have training from multiple local, state, and federal agencies in a variety of emergency response roles. In addition to this training there are years of personal and professional experience in technologies used to support public service entities.

Our training in emergency response gives us the ability to help our governmental emergency responders, volunteer responders, our neighbors, and ourselves when emergency management communication expertise is most needed.
